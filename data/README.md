# Data Sources and Licensing

In this analysis, we are working with multiple datasets. Due to space limitations, I have uploaded a few of the larger files to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yR7RkC28EGOouKa2W3QquWPzH_bZP3I_?usp=sharing). The main ones are included in this repository in the [`data/`](https://github.com/parvatijay2901/data-512-project-part-3-4/tree/main/data) folder.

## Input data

    - **Description:** The dataset includes detailed information on wildfires and prescribed fires across the United States from the mid-1800s to the present.â€‹ It merges data from 40 different sources, providing a rich and comprehensive view of wildfire activity over time. The dataset can be accessed from [Combined wildland fire datasets for the United States and certain territories, 1800s-Present (combined wildland fire polygons)](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/61aa537dd34eb622f699df81) or (can be downloaded directly from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q2MNu6gKvN5TLv3YmcEbODpEzxJcOa8e/view?usp=share_link)).

        - **Fire_Year:** The calendar year when the fire occurred as determined by the dataset creators.
        - **Fire_Polygon_Tier:** The tier from which the fire polygon was generated; one or more polygons within the tier could be combined to create the fire polygon.

2. **Air Quality Index Data:** Air Quality Data was needed to evaluate the performance of the smoke estimate created. 
    - **Description:** This data was requested from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality Service (AQS) API. This is a historical API and does not provide real-time air quality data. The [documentation](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html) for the API provides definitions of the different call parameters and examples of the various calls that can be made to the API. The US EPA was created in the early 1970's. The EPA reports that they only started broad based monitoring with standardized quality assurance procedures in the 1980's. Many counties will have data starting somewhere between 1983 and 1988. However, some counties still do not have any air quality monitoring stations. The API helps resolve this by providing calls to search for monitoring stations and data using either station ids, or a county designation or a geographic bounding box. Some additional information on the Air Quality System can be found in the [EPA FAQ on the system](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/frequent-questions-about-airdata). 
    - **Columns:**
        - **date:** Date of the observed air quality measurement.
        - **site_id:** Unique identifier for the air quality monitoring site.
        - **state:** The state where the monitoring site is located.
        - **county:** The county designation for the air quality monitoring site.
        - **pollutant_type:** Type of pollutant being measured (e.g., PM2.5, Ozone).
        - **sample_duration:** Length of time the sample was taken (e.g., 24 hours).
        - **arithmetic_mean:** Average concentration of the pollutant for the specified sample duration.
        - **AQI:** Air Quality Index value calculated based on the measured pollutant concentration, indicating the overall air quality level.
        - **value_represented:** Description of what is captured by the parameter being measured.
        - **observation_count:** Total number of observations used to calculate the arithmetic mean for that day.
    - **Access:** The AQS API is publicly accessible and provides access to ambient air sample data collected by various pollution control agencies. Users are expected to be familiar with the terms of service that govern the use of the API. These [terms](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html#terms) outline acceptable usage practices and any restrictions on data access and storage.
